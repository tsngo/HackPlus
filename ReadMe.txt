Gain 5 hacking skill points after each successful hack. Inspiration came from watching ChristopherOdd's Lengendary Ironman playthrough on YouTube. +5 is configable using ini. I also left debug settings in the ini which makes hacks always succeed and makes them not cost an action (similar to lightning hands). These are off by default. Techno-bable follows: This mod uses UIScreenListener to modify FinalizeHack and FinalizeIntrusion templates from X2Ability_DefaultAbilitySet and X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet classes.Anything that modifies hacking in these two templates will likely conflict.
